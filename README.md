## Architecture

The app was initialised completely from scratch.

It retrives the data using the [SWR](https://github.com/vercel/swr) <i>by</i> [vercel](https://vercel.com/). The data comes from the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API. This method was used in order to format the weather data into readable data all inside the same hook in a clean and comprehensive way.

Integrates a simple yet efficient search feature that allows the user to search for different cities around the world by name and update get the weather forecast in real time. Achieved with the combination of the debounce method from lodash, a custom handler and the useMemo hook from React.

Components were built in a fashion that allows for a more responsive, dynamic and scalable experience.

The UI is meant to be minimalistic yet engaging and intuitive. It was built using TailwindCSS to allow great control and autonomy over the layout of the app and also the design/feel of all the elements within it. The UI was designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes.

Mock data was generated with the help of [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/) and the formated by hand.
